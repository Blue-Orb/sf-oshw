The AT90USB1286 (or its host-capable 1287 counterpart) is one of the most compact and comprehensively powerful AVR microcontrollers I have had the pleasure of using so far. If you're looking to integrate this MCU into one of your projects, the IsNoTeensy++ design is a perfect starting point. Details on the design process available here:

Let me be extremely up-front about something: I am not trying to steal market share from Paul over at PJRC, the guy behind the real Teensy++. The IsNoTeensy++ is an almost perfect clone of the circuit and PCB layout, but it is not exactly the same thing as a real Teensy from PRJC for a few critical reasons:

- No Halfkay bootloader. You can't use the IsNoTeensy++ directly with Teensyduino or the Arduino IDE unless you manage to get a compatible bootloader on there yourself.

- You can't buy the IsNoTeensy++ anywhere. You have to build it yourself or have somebody else do it. With a 64-pin MLF IC and many 0402 SMDs onboard, this is going to be either difficult or expensive.

- The IsNoTeensy design comes AS-IS with absolutely no support or guarantees. You're on your own.

In contrast, if you buy a real Teensy++ from PJRC, you get a pre-built, tested board that integrates perfectly with Arduino software and has a devoted and very helpful guy behind it. On top of all this, the real Teensy has a very wide user base and proven track record. This is definitely worth the $24 it takes to get one from PJRC. If you want a Teensy, BUY A TEENSY:

Now that that's out of the way, if you're looking to integrate the AT90USB1286 (or USB-host-capable AT90USB1287) microcontroller into your design, this is a great way to get started.

Note that you should use Eagle 6.1 or later for full compatibility with the design. The USB connector uses a single pin connection to designate five pads on the connector package itself, and this is a new feature introduced in v6.
